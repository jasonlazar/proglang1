# Programming Languages I

In this course we learned 4 programming languages to compare different programming paradigms. Those are:
1. Functional Programming
2. Logic Programming
3. Scripting Languages
4. Object-Oriented Programming

We were given 4 different problems, each of which we had to solve in a variety of languages.
